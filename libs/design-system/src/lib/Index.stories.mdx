<h1>Monster hunter world companion Design system</h1>

The Design System is structured following ATOMIT ([ITCSS](https://itcss.io/) + [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)).

In this documentation you will find:

## Styles

Documentation on: `settings` and `tools`, such as typography or color variables and mixins.

## Objects

Class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, such as [Container](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/objects-container--container-section).

## Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, such as [Input](?path=/story/atoms-forms-input--default) or [Button](?path=/story/atoms-button--primary).

## Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound, such as the [Side Menu](?path=/story/molecules-sidemenu--side-menu).
